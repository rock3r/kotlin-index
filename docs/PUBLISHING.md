# Publishing

`kotlin-code-index` publishes a thin JVM artifact to the Sonatype Central Portal with the
[`com.vanniktech.maven.publish`](https://github.com/vanniktech/gradle-maven-publish-plugin)
plugin. The Shadow `*-all.jar` remains the standalone CLI distribution and the `*-shrunk.jar`
remains an internal native-packaging input. Both are deliberately excluded from the Maven
publication.

## Consumer coordinates

Consumers need no publishing or kotlin-code-index-specific Gradle plugin. Add the artifact as a
normal dependency:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("dev.sebastiano.kotlinindex:kotlin-code-index:<version>")
}
```

Maven consumers use the equivalent coordinates:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>dev.sebastiano.kotlinindex</groupId>
  <artifactId>kotlin-code-index</artifactId>
  <version>VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```

The published POM supplies Kotlin, Clikt, kotlinx.serialization, Xodus, and SLF4J runtime
dependencies transitively. Consumers do not need to assemble a fat JAR or duplicate that list.

## Local verification

The default version on `main` is `0.2.0-SNAPSHOT`. No credentials or signing key are required to
verify the publication locally:

```bash
./gradlew verifyMavenPublication
```

The task publishes to an isolated repository under `build/test-maven-repository/` and checks:

- the main, sources, javadoc, POM, and Gradle module metadata artifacts exist
- the main artifact contains kotlin-code-index classes but no bundled dependency classes
- the Shadow `*-all.jar`, R8 `*-shrunk.jar`, and optional Shadow runtime variant are absent from
  both artifacts and publication metadata
- the POM contains Central-required name, description, URL, license, SCM, developer, and
  dependency metadata

`./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` is also available for testing a consumer build against the local
Maven repository.

## Tag-driven release flow

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs for tags shaped like `v<semver>`. It strips the leading `v`,
runs the full check and publication verifier with that release version, signs every publication
artifact with the in-memory PGP key, and uploads to the Sonatype Central Portal.

The build uses `automaticRelease = false`, matching Spectre's cautious release flow. A successful
workflow leaves the validated deployment waiting for manual promotion in the Central Portal.

Required repository secrets:

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME` | Central Portal user-token username |
| `MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD` | Central Portal user-token password |
| `SIGNING_IN_MEMORY_KEY` | ASCII-armored PGP private key |
| `SIGNING_IN_MEMORY_KEY_PASSWORD` | PGP private-key passphrase |

Before the first release, confirm that the Central Portal account can publish under the verified
`dev.sebastiano` namespace. Then push an already-reviewed release commit and its version tag:

```bash
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

After the workflow succeeds, inspect the deployment in the Central Portal and promote it manually.
